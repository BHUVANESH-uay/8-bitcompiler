# 8-bitcompiler
The 8-bit Compiler is a simple educational tool designed to translate a basic high-level language into assembly-like instructions for a hypothetical 8-bit architecture. It focuses on the fundamental concepts of lexing, parsing, and code generation, handling variable assignments and arithmetic expressions to produce assembly-like output.
